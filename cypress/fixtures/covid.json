Following the first Covid-19 wave, we undertook a study of 178 children from 12 hospitals in south and north-east London, Kent and Sussex who had developed type 1 diabetes between January and July 2020. We found that the prevalence of newly diagnosed children was high when compared with the levels of type 1 diabetes seen in the previous four years. But two inner south London hospitals had unusually high numbers of children with type 1 diabetes.</p> <p>The children who had developed diabetes in the pandemic were significantly sicker than before, with a higher level of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/\" title=\"\">diabetic ketoacidosis</a> when they arrived at hospital. This did not relate to a delay in coming to hospital. We also know of two children where there was evidence that their diabetes was triggered by a Covid-19 infection. We are undertaking detailed studies as we believe that there may be link between the two conditions; the cause of type 1 diabetes is complex, but it appears that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid-19 infections may be a trigger factor.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Dr Tony Hulse </strong><em>Consultant paediatric endocrinologist, Evelina London children’s hospital, and </em><strong>Dr Caroline Ponmani</strong> <em>Consultant in paediatric emergency medicine, Queens hospital, Romford</em></p> <p>• Diabetes of both types is likely to arise after Covid-19 because each condition is due to inflammation, particularly in blood vessels. Problems in larger arteries precede overt type 2 diabetes by several years, with recent evidence showing smaller vessels are impaired. Whether that occurs in the pancreas, leading to type 1 diabetes, is not yet known.</p> <p>Excess fat tissue, which small blood vessels run through, is also inflamed, setting up a chronic “pro-inflammatory” state that Covid can aggravate. Such early damage promotes longer-term issues in both types of diabetes in the eyes and kidneys, with larger vessel damage underlying heart attacks and strokes.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>JK Cruickshank</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Emeritus professor, cardiovascular medicine and diabetes, King’s College London,</em><em> and </em><em>consultant physician, Guy’s &amp; St Thomas’ hospitals</em></p>"
